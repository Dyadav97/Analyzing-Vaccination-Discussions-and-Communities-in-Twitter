# Analyzing Vaccination Discussions and Communities in Twitter


# Introduction
Vaccine misconceptions on the internet may play a role in the rise of anti-vaccine attitude and vaccine apprehension. To discover vaccine and antiviral drugs online communities, social media site information was developed to determine Twitter vaccine personalities, their online twitter neighbourhoods, and their geo-locations. Numerous social discussion boards devoted  to vaccinations have formed in recent times, affecting public perception on vaccination. These vaccine-related societies have taken advantage of social network to efficiently promote various ideas. Predictive analytics offers the methods and techniques needed to evaluate large amounts of data and uncover new information. This paper indicates the use of these algorithms to find and track vaccination-related discussion forums on Online Communities. Result suggests that exploring social media influ- encers appears to be an effective strategy to discover and target anti-vaccine networks online. Detection and surveillance of these social groupings might be used by public health organisations to prevent epidemic.

# Background and Context

Data visualization aids in the telling of stories by performing data into a more understandable format and
emphasizing patterns and outliers. It is hard for human brain to comprehend raw data. Displaying various graphs
are impactful and well communicated. Because of insights we are able to identify areas that need improvement
and also helps to find issues before it happen.
Due to the huge volume of data, IT also faces problems. Errors, duplicate entries, and rectified data should all be
accessible for processing. Without regard for preparation, the organization gathers data. Second, there is a lack
of knowledge about data visualization and technologies in schools, and trustworthy data is not provided,
regardless of whether the presentation is biased and represents anything different than reality. There are a lot of
statements that aren’t true. Tableau, Google Charts, Info gram, and Data Wrapper are just a few examples of
technologies that may be used to display enormous amounts of data. This visualization will be entirely
automated in the near future .

# Research Questions
(1)	What criteria are used to anticipate the  flow  and  data associated with large-scale information regarding vaccines?
(2)	What are people’s attitudes on vaccines, and who has impacted them?
(3)	Will societal preferences change as a result of the vaccination analysis? Can the government assist by developing new strategies?

# Methods
I will be using Gephi software for network analysis. Which will create a database by capturing a part of network
to work on visualization. Apart from that anaconda, jupyter notebook will be used for any type of graphical
representation and community detection.

# Data extraction
•	Twitter: Twitter is a social media platform where users may post personal information in the form of tweets. Tweets are 140-character messages that provide information such as thoughts, photographs, and links. The re-tweet is a  unique type of tweet that occurs when one user reposts  another  user’s tweet. Every day, Twitter  users send about 400 mil-  lion tweets, which are accessible via public APIs that allow users to search for tweets using keywords, hashtags, phrases, geographic locations, or user names. All tweets containing  the phrase ’vaccines’ were used to compile the data for this study matrices, which represent the reach of the knowledge transfer after the fifth tweet, are created by extracting and adding the number of followers of each subsequent people first  from data. By multiplying the total number  of  seconds  between the first tweet and the first five retweets by the number of seconds between the first tweet and the first five retweets,   the time lag variable is produced.

# Practical Considerations
Third-party applications and developers can access the massive quantity of data created by Twitter users every
day. This is accomplished using the Twitter REST API, which provides a variety of endpoints for obtaining
data. When developing the web tool, we were particularly interested in the endpoint that allows us to get tweets
from a specific user. We also make use of the Twitter Search API’s search features. This is used to find tweets
that contain a certain search phrase, including both the keyword and the hashtag

# Conclusion
This paper demonstrates how to use Information Retrieval Techniques to identify and analyse Twitter networks that disseminate vaccination ideas. The vaccination coverage per- centages, as well as a dataset gathered from Twitter. The findings of this early investigation reveal that vaccine opinions expressed on Twitter may have an impact on vaccination judgement in some situations. However, it is worth noting that
 
the majority of Twitter communities discussing  vaccination are not anti-vaccine. In reality, the majority of newly formed movements now favour vaccination and are working to boost incidence rate. Considering all of the reported test findings, it can be stated that the data mining techniques used are appro- priate for this type of investigation. The suggested approach may be used to locate and monitor vaccination activities, as well as to uncover new information in data that can be utilised to promote better health immunisation initiatives. Furthermore, this newly gained knowledge might be utilised to identify and find groups resistant to vaccination, which could contribute to future deadly diseases in other countries of the globe. In the future, work discussions may be studied to see which countries are dealing with which crises, and solutions can be discussed to see if there is a link between them.
