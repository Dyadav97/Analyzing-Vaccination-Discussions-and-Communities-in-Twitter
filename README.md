# Geo-location-based-Community-detection-in-Twitter


# Introduction
Data moved from being rare, expensive, and difficult to locate and gather during the digitalization period to
being abundant, inexpensive, and extremely complex to analyses and interpret, resulting in big data. This digital
gold is coupled with machine learning to develop efficient analytics procedures that reveal the worth of data.
This data visualization is the process of converting raw data into graphs, charts, pictures, and even films so that
we may get understanding from it.

# Background and Context

Data visualization aids in the telling of stories by performing data into a more understandable format and
emphasizing patterns and outliers. It is hard for human brain to comprehend raw data. Displaying various graphs
are impactful and well communicated. Because of insights we are able to identify areas that need improvement
and also helps to find issues before it happen.
Due to the huge volume of data, IT also faces problems. Errors, duplicate entries, and rectified data should all be
accessible for processing. Without regard for preparation, the organization gathers data. Second, there is a lack
of knowledge about data visualization and technologies in schools, and trustworthy data is not provided,
regardless of whether the presentation is biased and represents anything different than reality. There are a lot of
statements that aren’t true. Tableau, Google Charts, Info gram, and Data Wrapper are just a few examples of
technologies that may be used to display enormous amounts of data. This visualization will be entirely
automated in the near future .

# Methods
I will be using Gephi software for network analysis. Which will create a database by capturing a part of network
to work on visualization. Apart from that anaconda, jupyter notebook will be used for any type of graphical
representation and community detection.

# Practical Considerations
Third-party applications and developers can access the massive quantity of data created by Twitter users every
day. This is accomplished using the Twitter REST API, which provides a variety of endpoints for obtaining
data. When developing the web tool, we were particularly interested in the endpoint that allows us to get tweets
from a specific user. We also make use of the Twitter Search API’s search features. This is used to find tweets
that contain a certain search phrase, including both the keyword and the hashtag
